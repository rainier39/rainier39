## About Me
I'm a university student. I created this account for posting my personal projects for employers, posterity, or whoever happens to take an interest. Some of my interests are:
- Cybersecurity
- PHP/Web Applications in general
- Python (my favorite coding language)
- C/C++ (whenever performance/speed is needed)
- Web Scraping (also a general fascination with using Python to interact with websites)
- Linux (I daily drive Debian)
- Home Servers (Minecraft servers, DNS servers, HTTP servers, File servers)
- FOSS (Free Open-Source Software)
- Privacy/Network Security
- Cryptography
- Virtual Machines/Different OSes

My best projects can be found under my pinned repositories. Most of my repositories are random programs I've made which I may or may not ever update again.
